### Work experience


__[Zedge](http://zedge.net/), 2007 -__

Zedge is a distributor of mobile content; Ringtones, wallpapers, apps and
games. Zedge has over 70 million users across web, iOS and Android.
From 2006 until 2011, I worked as lead designer/art-director and made
numerous tools to make it easier to work with graphics across platforms.
Since 2011, I've been employed as developer, working in the front-end team.
We use a framework we've produced ourselves. The framework is written in
php and we use sass and javascript for client-code. In the time I've spent
at Zedge, I have learned to master the commandline and vim to great extent,
this is something that's made me much more efficient as a developer.

__Cargosafe, 2011 -__

I am hired as system-developer to create Cargosafe's Restfull API and online
solutions. Cargosafe does realtime-tracking of vehicles and their cargo to
ensure safe delivery. Data is retrieved from a swarm of sensors through a
RESTful API and can be viewed on any platform. The system relies heavily on
MongoDb, MyDB, Node-js and Component-js.


__Tåke (freelance), 2005 - 2006__

I did a lot of work for Cravemedia and Web-dynamic. I also engaged clients
on my own. All of which was mostly web development related. I designed using
the Adobe suite and programmed in php and actionscript.


__His Majesty The King´s Guard, 2004 - 2005__

I was in the SIBO-unit, dealing with explosives. During my service I
created the layout and design of the internal magazine from cover to cover.
