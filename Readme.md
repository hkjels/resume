### Development experience


__[Zedge](http://zedge.net/) (fulltime), 2006 -__

Until 2011, most of my experience in Zedge was as lead designer. Since then
I have worked mostly as a developer in the front-end team. At Zedge I work
with technologies such as php, sass and javascript. And occationally some
design-work in Photshop and illustrator.


__Cargosafe (parttime), 2011 -__

I am at the moment the developer and sole architect of the Cargosafe api
and online solutions. Cargosafe does realtime-tracking of vehicles and
their cargo. The server-side is mostly node.js based and uses MonoDb for
storage. All realtime manipulation is done through socket.io and displayed
using jade and jade-vu views as well as stylus for stylesheets.


__Freelance as Tåke, Henrik Kjelsberg, 2004 - 2006__

I did a lot of work for Cravemedia and Web dynamic. I also engaged clients
on my own. All of which was mostly web development related. I designed
using the Adobe suite and programmed in php and actionscript.
