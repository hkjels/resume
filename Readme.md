### Development philosophy

In web-development there's a lot of fragmentation. To deal with it all, I
believe you need to know the right set of tools. I've found that keeping
things dead-simple, normalizing everything that can be normalized and using
the most human friendly tools available, really helps when efficiency counts.
My biggest aha-moments in development the last couple of years is the use
of javascript and json. Having the same code run client and server-side,
as well as using strictly one format to pass data around, makes sense to me.
This is why I believe the future of software-development now lies in web.
