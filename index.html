<h3>Work experience</h3>

<p><strong><a href="http://zedge.net/">Zedge</a>, 2006 -</strong></p>

<p>Zedge is a distributor of mobile content; Ringtones, wallpapers, apps and
games. Zedge has over 70 million users across iOS and Android.
Until 2011, most of my experience in Zedge was as lead designer. Since then
I have worked as a developer in the front-end team. At Zedge I work with
technologies such as javascript, sass, php and occasionally some design-work
in Illustrator and Photshop.</p>

<p><strong>Cargosafe (consultant), 2011 -</strong></p>

<p>I am hired as a consultant to create Cargosafe's Restfull API and online
solutions. Cargosafe does realtime-tracking of vehicles and their cargo to
ensure safe delivery. The system relies heavily on web-sockets, MongoDb and
node-js.</p>

<p><strong>Tåke (freelance), 2004 - 2006</strong></p>

<p>I did a lot of work for Cravemedia and Web-dynamic. I also engaged clients
on my own. All of which was mostly web development related. I designed using
the Adobe suite and programmed in php and actionscript.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Language skills</h3>

<p>I am proficient in written and spoken Norwegian and English.</p>
